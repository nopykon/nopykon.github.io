<p>Made for a gamejam over at <a href="https://indiegamedev.se/content.php">indiegamedev.se</a>. Written in Java and rendered using openGL, it ran (and still does afaik) on both PC and Android. The PC version <b>does require Java (JRE)</b> to run (and the Android version is nowhere to be found).</b></p>

<HH>UZI DUDE</HH>
<p>A lil' game I submitted for LD37. Terrible game, but I was happy with the graphics at least.

<HH>Fantasy Console Games</HH>
<p>I've made a bunch of demos for the fantasy console TIC-80. Both of these two were intended to become games, but then time ran out, so they ended up as demos. Well, enjoy the gifs.</i></p>

<p><i>My first fantasy console demo, made in 2017 for FCGJ#1.</i> This demo was fancy for a while, because it was made before TIC-80 had the function <i>textri()</i>. You can try it out <a href="https://tic.computer/play?cart=230">here</a>, but you're best off just watching the gif, because that's all there is to the demo anyways.</p>

<p>And here is another FC-demo, made for Ludum Dare 39 IIRC. You can check it out in the TIC-80 demo section <a href="https://tic.computer/play?cart=178">here</a>.</p>
