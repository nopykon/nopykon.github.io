<h2> Fixed-Point Arithmetic</h2>

<p>The Playstation and other old computers did not have floating-point support built-in to the the hardware. Technically, floating-point calculations can be done in software, but that is often too slow and impractical for the purpose of games where speed is crucial.</p>

<p>As you may have figured out, I'm very inspired by the Playstation 1, and I always wanted to understand how those games from my childhood were made. I decided to make an entire game engine using nothing but fixed-point arithmetic in order to get comfortable with it. Ironically, doing so has also thought me to understand and appreciate the floating-point standard (IEEE-754) a lot more as well.</p> 

<p>In this post I'll try to describe the fixed-point format and how to perform fixed-point arithmetic.</p>
<!-- p>After a couple of years of using it, I'm very confortable with the basic operations. The biggest issue that are still find annoying is the risk of integer overflow, typically when the product of a multiplication becomes too large to contain in a 16-bit or 32-bit integer.</p -->

	BASICS

-->
<h3>Basics</h3>
<p>Fixed-point is a method of storing whole and fractional parts of a real number in an integer, and fixed-point Arithmetic is a way to perform arithmetic operations on those.</p>

<p>With fixed-point, N number of bits of an integer are used to represent the fractional part, where the rest is used to represent whole integer value.</p>

<p>For example, if 8 bits are used for the integer as well as the fractional part:</p>

<p> IIIIIIII.FFFFFFFF </p>

<p>That's 8 I's and 8 F's. The higher significance bits (I) contain the integer part, and the lower significance bits (F) contain the fractional part.</p>

<p>You could note this format as '8.8'. When commenting code, I often just type 'X.8', because the upper bits may not be of importance for the purpose of the comment. (It's not my invention by the way, just a thing I've picked up reading code.)</p>


<p>Here's the decimal number 1.25 as fixed-point in binary:<br>&emsp;
  00000001.01000000</p>

<p>The integer-part as a standalone integer would have the value of 1. Since it's left-shifted 8 bits, it has the value of 256. If converted properly to a float, it would go back to having the value '1.0'.</p>
<p>The fractional part is a '1' left-shifted 6 bits, or 64 which is the product of 256 * 0.25.</p>

<p>If you were to add up 256 and 64, you'd get 320. That looks like this in binary:<br>&emsp;
  00000001 01000000<br>
  And with the fixed-point dot at the 8th bit:<br>&emsp;
  00000001.01000000</p>
<p>So there's nothing strange or mysterious going on here. It's like if you were to express 0.9 meters by writing 90 centimeters. Or instead of 0.75 feet write 9 inches. Except here, your meter/feet unit would be be some power of two of the cm/inch unit, not 100 or 12. A useful quirk.</p>

<p>For easy of reading, I'll stick to X.8 throughout this post, but you can use any number of fractional bits. There are no rules. Use what's practical. I use a wide range of formats in my games.</p> 

<!-- h4>Conversion</h4>
<p>Conversion from float to X.8 fixed-point can be done in this way in C:
  int_value = (int) ( 256 * float_value) ; </p>

<p>Conversion from X.8 fixed-point to float can be done like this:
  float_value = int_value / 256.f; or  float_value = int_value * (1.f / 256.f);</p -->

	ADDITION

-->

<h4>Addition and Subtraction</h4>
<p>Plus and minus work the same as with regular decimals, nothing strange needs to happen. 2.0 + 0.5 would translate to 512 + 128, and the result would be 640.&emsp;2.5 = 640.0 / 256.0 </p>

<!-- 

	 MULTIPLICATION

-->
<h3>Multiplication</h3>
<p>This is where it gets tricky, and even more so considering the risk of overflow (more on that later).</p>

<p>Because the integers are left-shifted, multiplying produces a much larger number than we want. 1.0 * 1.0 should produce 1.0 again, but 256*256 produces 65356, which is wrong.<br>&emsp;
  In fact, it's too large by a factor of 256, or 8 bits. So we need to either divide by 256 (1<<number of fractional bits), or simply right-shift by the number of fractional bits. </p>

<p>
  &emsp;
  256 = 256 * 256 / 256<br>&emsp;
  256 = 256 * 256 >> 8<br>&emsp;
	product = factor * factor / 256 <br>&emsp;
	product = factor * factor >> 8 <br>&emsp;
</p>

<p>There <b>are</b> differences between right-shifting and dividing if the input is negative. For example (-1)/256 will be 0 whereas (-1)>>8 will remain -1.</p>

<p>Safest bet is to always use division. When dividing by a literal like '256', the compiler will most likely figure out that the (expensive) division can be replaced by a shift, and if some additional (cheap) instructions if the input is signed.</p>
 
<p>I personally like to use >> when I know the input is going to be positive, or where small errors are negligible.</p>

<h3>Division</h3>
<p>Performing division is similar to multiplication, just the other way around. 1.0/1.0 should be 1.0, but 256/256 is just 1, which if converted back to decimal would be 1.0/256.0 or 0.00390625. So before performing the division, we either multiply the input by 256 again, or left-shift it by 8.</p>

<p>&emsp;
  ratio = dividend * 256 / divisor<br>&emsp;
  ratio = ( dividend << 8 ) / divisor<br>&emsp;
</p>	 

<p>(There is again a risk of overflow if the dividend is so large that less than 8 leading bits remain.)</p>


<!--


	OVERFLOW

-->

<h4>Overflow</h4>
<p>A challenge when using fixed-point is to avoid integer overflow. It easily occurs when performing multiplication and division.</p>

<p>For example, on a 16-bit CPU using 8.8 fixed-point format; even multiplying 1.0 with 1.0 may cause trouble.</p>

<p> 65536 = 256 * 256<br>
  65536 is '1 0000 0000 0000 0000' in binary.</p>

<p>That is 17 bits. Even though you should right-shift by 8 after the operation, the overflow has already happened on a 16-bit CPU. It's something you must be aware of. (On some CPU's there are flags that will be set when overflow happens (CF, OF on x86), the result may still be useful for continuing to work towards a desired outcome. ) </p>

<p>On a 32 or 64-bit CPU, this case (256*256) wouldn't cause overflow as we have many bits to spare, but you still need to watch out when using larger numbers, or perhaps more fractional bits.</p>

<p>In truth, it's no different from multiplication with regular integers, it's just easy to blow up because of the large left-shift, especially when chaining multiplications. </p>

<!-- p>Perhaps if x is large when doing the fixed point equivalent of 'x*x*x' <br>&emsp;
x * x * x  >> 8 + 8<br>
You may want to do<br>&emsp;
(x*x>>8) * x >> 8</p -->

<p>One way to avoid overflow is to separate the integer and fractional parts:</p>

<p>
  aI = a >> 8<br>
  aF = a & 255<br>
  bI = b >> 8<br>
  bF = b & 255<br>
<br>
  r = (ai * bi) << 8<br>
  r += ai * bf <br>
  r += bi * af <br>
  r += af * bf >> 8<br>
</p>


<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>In contrast to floating-point, where numbers are distributed with greater separation the further away from 1.0 you get, with integers they are uniformly spaced out, and thus you will reach INT_MAX sooner than you''d reach FLT_MAX.</p>
 
<p>You can <i>abstract away</i> a lot of the misery, but in the end, fixed-point simply demands more awareness of the bits and the range of variables you use in expressions.</p>

<p>But there are some benefits too. There's no drop in precision as you go further from 1.0, which might make it preferable when you knowing the confines of a space or simulation.<br>&emsp;
  It's also nice to be able use a lot of power-of-two bit-twiddling hacks directly on the format, as with all integers. Avoiding int-to-float conversions (and then back again) is quite nice too, when you're doing things like iterating colors, sound samples, or other situations where a low-bit integer format is expected.</p>

<p>Toodeloo!</p>
<!--  I might just add a second part to this post about some of the neater mechanics and functions I've come across, or perhaps a section about doing linear algebra, in fixed-point. But for now - Have a nice day!</p -->
