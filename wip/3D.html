<!-- h2 id="chars">Low Poly Characters</h2>
<p>Here are some 3D-characters I've modelled, textured, rigged and animated.</p -->


<h4>Big Purple Space Monster</h4>
<div>

  <p>With an arm-cannon. It uses two 64x64 textures, each with its own 16-color palette.</p>

</div>


<h4>Dude</h4>
<div>

  <p>A character designed for a first person shooter.</p><!--  It's a challenge is to make the very low-poly mesh fold, twist and turn well in many different poses, holding and using many different types of weapons as well as running, jumping, strafing, backpedaling and falling over.</p -->

  <img src="../img/walk.gif" />
</div>


  <h4>Enemy#1</h4>
<div>

  <p>An enemy with bird-like features, designed to be the equivalent of the "Jackal" from Halo.</p>

<!-- h4>Seal Princess</h4>
<div>
  <p>Had an idea for a shmup/shooting game in the vein of Mushihimesama where you play a princess on a flying seal (instead of a giant bug).</p>

<h3>Action Game Heroine</h3>
<p>Slightly higher poly-count and texture-resolution and designed with texture-filtering in mind. Big continious UV-islands and seams where it doesn't hurt.</p>

<h2 id="weapons">Weapons</h2>
<p>Here are some weapon models used in my FPS project. Each weapon rigged, animated and textured with 16-color 64x64 images. They are made to look good from the first person perspective, sacrifices in detail are made where it mostly goes unseen.</p>

<!-- p>Coming soon: vehicles, environmental meshes and entire levels. Until then, goodbye!</p -->
<!-- h3 id="levels">Leveldesign</h3>
<p>I started out making maps for CS 1.6, and I still have an interest in level design, but I never got very good very good at the Desing part. Too much focus put on the visuals.</p -->
