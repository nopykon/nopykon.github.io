<h1>First Person Shooter</h1>

<p>Work in progress</p>

<h3>Pitch (WIP)</h3>
<p><i>Kill the bad guys, find the exit.</i> <br>&emsp;It's a first person shooter with emphasis on combat, exploration and atmosphere.</p>
<p>The extraterrestrials conspire to erase humanity from the surface of the earth. It falls upon you, the player, to stop them. You must visit their many cells, scattered around the globe, to disrupt their operation and destroy the life-threatening equipment they plan to use against us.</p>



<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Fun, challenging and rewarding combat loop.</li>
  <li>Navigation and exploration through beautiful low-poly environments high in variability (some levels aren't even that grey-brown).</li>
  
  <li>Five enemy types with well tweaked senses, extensive pathfinding skills and expressive animation to reveal intent and morale. Additional bosses and nonhostile creatures.</li>

  <li>Plenty of weapons. Handguns, machine guns, shotguns, grenades and rockets. And the arsenal of the enemy. All with different strengths and weaknesses.</li>
  
  <li>A concise experience. No unskippable cutscenes or other bloat. The game tries hard not to waste your time.</li>
  
  <li>Vomitingly Beautiful Visuals. PS1 stylized graphics achieved through Software Rendering (OpenGL Hardware Renderer in the works, functional but with some minor glitches).</li>
  <li>Affine texture-mapping and correction via on the fly subdivision.</li>
  <li>Baked and dynamic per-vertex lighting.</li>
  <li>Levels consisting of up to (<i>checks source code</i>) ...3072 polygons!</li>
  <li>All models and textures made exclusively for this game.</li>
  
  <li>Amazing particles and effects that adds to the mood and the carnage.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Origin of the idea</h3>
<p>I love Tomb Raider on Playstation 1. The feeling I get when playing it is hard to describe, but I'll try. A sense of place and danger, feeling exposed to the elements and alone (but in a good way). You really are on your own in that game, it certainly doesn't play itself.</p>

<p>But as good as it is, and even though I personally don't mind the tank controls, and even though I still like the way it looks; the game is dated.</p>

<p>The shooty action parts in particular. It worked well enough against animals that you could just use acrobatics to get away from. Fighting enemies equipped with hitscan weaponry on the other hand, was mostly about exploiting the weird situations the AI would get itself into, where you can hurt them but they cannot return fire. Or just could accept the bullets and use lots and lots of medkits.</p>

<p>Wouldn't it be great with a game like Tomb Raider, where the action scenes instead were as fun as they are in something like Halo or Doom?</p>

<p>Well, there you have my idea. I hope to</p>



-30s fun
-TR exploration/mystery

	

<h4>Plattforming in First Person?</h4>
<p>Metroid Prime proved that it can work, as long as it's well implemented. It won't be the same kind of platforming as seen in Tomb Raider with all the climbing and doing backflips.</p>

<h4>Aren't you just describing Metroid Prime?</h4>
<p>Besides exploration, the Prime games are upgrading Samus's abilities, as well as very long and difficult boss fights. In my game, I want to player ability to be mostly the same throughout, besides picking up more powerful weapons every now and then, but your standard issue hand pistol should still do the job near the end.</p>


<h3>Swimming</h3>
I think it would be cool to have swimming in the game. It allows for some 6-DOF. But I'm not sure how well I could make it work within a short time-span.</p>


<h3>Story/Setting (Why are there Aliens?)</h3>
<p>I didn't like the idea of gunning down hundreds humans in this game. I don't mind games like Counter-Strike or Half-Life, because there it makes sense for other humans to be hostile. But if you're just exploring a ancient places, why should everyone there be trying to kill you?</p>

<p>At the I still wanted humanoid shapes with equipped with shooty weaponry. I still like to pull off headshots and have enemies be roughly with the same target area as the player. So aliens it is. Meaty and juicy humanoid aliens from outer space, with interesting tech and cool visuals!</p>

<p>Having this great threat of an alien invasion also serves to highten the risc. You're not just hunting down ancient relics that <i>belongs in a museum</i>. You're saving humanity!</p>
