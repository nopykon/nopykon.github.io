<p>Aiming to finish a game. It might be a good resetter. I want to do so many things at once but cannot settle on one and I end up doing none, while still getting exhaused. Not sure if I need rest of discipline. I can do work. But not always. I think it's probably discipline... or a new approach to how I spend time. IDK. You'd think I'd have this stuff figured out by now, but I don't. Alcohol sure doesn't help neither.</p>


<p>But I'm in for the jam. Wish me luck.</p>

<p>Maybe I should striim.</p>


<p>I'll be using either JS and webGL, HTML5 Canvas + JS or something in C++. Not sure yet.</P>

<p>Oh well....</p>
