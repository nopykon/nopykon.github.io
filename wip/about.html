<h2>About me</h2>

ldkgjfal

<p>I'm born in Stockholm, Sweden, in 1990. My family moved to Gothenburg in 2001. Gothenburg sucks. STHLM FOREVER.</p>
<p>I finished "Gynmasiet", but I dropped out from Uni. Because I didn't like it, and felt like I was learning more
on my own (unfortunatly, you don't get any credit for that). I also had trouble paying rent while studying, and I didn't like the idea of lending money. So here I am without a degree.</p>

<p>That said, most people I look up to are dropouts as well.</p> 

And I didn't want to loan money. A lot of mistakes which has lead me to be near unemployable due to massive holes in my CV. But I'm not a drug addict or a criminal of any sort. And I've been managing to survive doing odd-jobs, freelance work as well as work for an advertizement bureau I run together with my dad (who is a copywriter).</p>
