<h1>Music</h1>

<p>Composing music is a side hobby of mine. I'm not good at it, but it's very rewarding nonetheless. Music feels very immediate compared to programming, where you sometimes spend a week programming with very little to show for it it at the end. (Side not, there are sub-categories in programming that also are immediate, for instance shader programming). </p>

<p>Anyhow, here are some tunes I've made.</p>
