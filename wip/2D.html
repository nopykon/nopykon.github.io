<h1>2D Art</h1>
<p>Here are some drawings and paintings I've made. I use an A6 Wacom tablet along with <b>Krita</b>, which I recently started using. Most paintings are done in <b>Gimp</b> though, since that's what I used before.<br>&emsp;
I've had much trouble getting the tablet working properly with recent releases of Gimp under Windows 10, so that's what really pushed me over to Krita. It's been worth it so far. The brushes really is lot better and the input works without any issues.</p>
<p>Enjoy the show.</p>

<!-- p>Before getting familiar with the superior art tool (programming), I used to paint quite a bit. I was thinking I could become a concept artist or a matte artist or similar. Unfortunately that dream died after after I got burnt too many times by scammers, willing to accept my work, but not willing to pay the agreed upon sum. And nowadays it appears as an even less profitable career path with all the AI stuff happening. Get in line and become the souless unthinking corporate asslicker you were born to be. But yeah, I still pick up ye olde wacom tablet every now and then. Maybe even as much as once per year!</p -->

<h2>Pixel Art</h2>
<p>Long has it been since last I made a "pixel-perfect" 2D-game, but here are some of the sprite sheets from that time.</p>
