<h1>Paintings & Doodles</h1>
<!-- h2>Paintings</h2 -->
<p>Here is some stuff I've drawn using a Wacom tablet and <b>Gimp</b>. I've recently made the jump over to <b>Krita</b>, which has been nice so far.</p>
<!-- I don't paint these "standalone" art pieces very often, much more of my time is spent doing 3D and textures (not to mention programming), but occasionally I get to make art for covers or posters for work, and sometimes I get swept in by some art challenge online.</p -->


<!-- p>Before getting familiar with the superior art tool (programming), I used to paint quite a bit. I was thinking I could become a concept artist or a matte artist or similar. Unfortunately that dream died after after I got burnt too many times by scammers, willing to accept my work, but not willing to pay the agreed upon sum. And nowadays it appears as an even less profitable career path with all the AI stuff happening. Get in line and become the souless unthinking corporate asslicker you were born to be. But yeah, I still pick up ye olde wacom tablet every now and then. Maybe even as much as once per year!</p -->

<h2>Pixel Art</h2>
