<h2>3D Modelling</h2>
<p><b>I begun my 3D modelling journey attemting to make maps for Counter-Strike 1.6 using Hammer (aka. "WorldCraft"). Since then I've used many different tools, but in recent years almost exclusively <b>Blender</b>.</p>
<p>Those who know me will know that I complain about Blender... a lot. There are some things that annoy me about the program and it's development, but in the end; It's a great piece of software and I'm very happy that it exists.</p> 

<h3>Low Poly</h3>
<p><b>Most of my recent work has been in a low poly style, inspired by PS1-era games.</b> Something about capturing life with just a few dozen polys brings me joy. </p>
