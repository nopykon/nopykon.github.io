<h1>Python Ray Tracer</h1>
<p><i>I had heard that python was slow, and yes, I had noticed some of my blender scripts taking a while to execute... but I never expected this.</i></p> 

<p>This is a small program that renders an image of a checkerboard plane and a sphere, and then stores it as a .bmp image.</p>

<p>Rendering a 640x480 resolution image takes one entire second.</p> 

<p>It's just horrifically slow. I'm flabbergasted.</p>



<p>I can run an equivalent or even more complicated program in real at 60Hz in a compiled C program, or even Lua or Javascript.</p>


<p>Anyhow, here's the code.</p>
