<h2>TIC-80 Projects</h2>

<p><b>TIC-80 is a <i>fantasy console</i> with artificial limitations similar to PICO-8. 16-colors, 240x136 and very limited space for code and data.</b> <p>You can run <a href="https://tic80.com/dev?id=312/" style="text-decoration:underline;"> my demos</a>, as well as creations of others on the <a href="https://tic80.com/" style="text-decoration:underline;">official TIC-80 website</a>.</p>


<p>I like this FC because it can be programmed with the full version of Lua (along with a bunch of other languages), as opposed to Pico-8 (the FC that made it a trend) which has some strange all-caps version (which I can see the charm of, but which would be a bigger sacrifice than I'd be willing to make for these kinds of side-projects. I'd rather go all in and progam a real retro console like PS1 or GBA if I'm going to put limits like that on myself).</p>

<h4>FPS Experiment</h4>
<p>Spent some time working on a demo in the first persion perspective in order to get real close to the polygons, because I had an idea on how to achieve el-shading via clipping that I wanted to try out.</p>

<p>Some basic running an jumping. The character you control is just a sphere, brute force collided against all the geometry.</p>

<p>This was made before perspective correct texturing was a thing in TIC-80, so to remedy the affinedness (?) some quick and dirty triangle subdivision is applied. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a while I completely nerded out on the subject of polygon subdivision, because I wanted to <i>perfect it</i> for other projects unrelated to TIC-80. Getting the maximum visual <i>bang for the buck</i>, using as little subdivision as possible, proved to be a challenge. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Note that the division at display on this page is very far from perfect. </p>

<p>I also wanted to try out on-the-fly "tesselation". Earlier lighting model is used here with positional lighting (and normals ignored). (Normals are still used by the... <i>vertex extrapolation function</i> in the tesselation.)</p>

<h3>Rasterizer Demo</h3>
<p>My first project on the platform was to write a rasterizer in Lua, to be used for an entry to a 2017 game jam (FCGJ#1). I had grandiose ideas for the game, but time objected to me making anything more than this little rollercoaster ride.

<h3>"LD39"</h3>
<p>And yet another demo, started on for Ludum Dare, most of the weekend just spent tinkering with the rendering and lighting.</p>

<p>That is all. Thanks for scrolling by.</p>
