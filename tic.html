<p>TIC-80 is a <i>fantasy console</i> with artificial limitations similar to PICO-8. 16-colors, 240x136 and very limited space for code and assets.</p>

<p><i>Had an idea I for lighting I wanted to try out.</i> It achieves a cel-shaded look by clipping polygons (when need be) by brightness. (No shaders and only 16-colors with TIC-80).</p>

<p>I also wanted to try out on-the-fly "tesselation". Earlier lighting model is used here with positional lighting (and normals ignored). (Normals are still used by the... <i>vertex extrapolation function</i> in the tesselation.)</p>

<p><i>My first fantasy console demo, made in 2017 for FCGJ#1.</i> This demo was fancy for a while, because it was made before TIC-80 had the function <i>textri()</i>. You can try it out <a href="https://tic.computer/play?cart=230">here</a>, but you're best off just watching the gif, because that's all there is to the demo anyways.</p>

<p>And here is another FC-demo, made for Ludum Dare 39 IIRC. You can check it out in the TIC-80 demo section <a href="https://tic.computer/play?cart=178">here</a>.</p>
