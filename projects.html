<h2>Fly</h2>
<p>A silly little flight-sim project.</p>

<br>
<p>Each surface is simulated, togethe forming the flight characteristics of the airplane as a whole. Can you spot the small square under the rudder? That was added, because otherwise the plane (with its flat planes :P) would have zero drag.</p><!--p>causing it to go extremely fast despite a very weak (invisible) engine. IIRC the thrust/mass-ratio is .25 or something like that, where the mass is calculated using the total wing-area, and depth at just One.</p-->

<h2>Minesweeper</h2>

<p>It's Minesweeper. It's a small enough game that you can enjoy the entire creation process.
  There's not much more to say about it other than "I had fun making it" and "I suck at playing it". :P  </p>

<h2>Raspberry Pi Project</h2>
<p>In 2016 I tried to make a game for Raspberry Pi Zero/Gen1. The engine was written using C++(98) and openGL ES2.0. It had shadowmapping, normalmapping, joint-animations and a bunch of other features.</p>
