<p>I failed to even begin working on a game for this years compo.
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="demo2/">Here's how far I got</a>. Most of the time spent experimenting with audio generation and canvas-rendering.</p>


<!--p>In preparation for this years compo, I worked on a shader that allows mip-mapping for an atlas texture, without wasting a ton of texture-space. <a href="test/">I have a webGL-demo right here.</a> OH NEVER MIND IT'S BROKEN NOW.</p>

<p>It's only trilinear filtering, not so nice compared to anisotropic filtering, but better than undersampling. When I get the time, I'll explain how it works, and how the mip-map atlas is generated. If you're impatient, the source code is also right there.

<!--h2>2019</h2>
<p>Earlier this year, anticipating JS13K, I worked on a shader that allows mip-mapping for an atlas texture, without wasting a ton of texture-space. <a href="test/">I have a webGL-demo right here.</a> It's only trilinear filtering, not so nice compared to anisotropic filtering, but better than undersampling. When I get the time, I'll explain how it works, and how the mip-map atlas is generated. If you're impatient, the source code is also right there.</p>

<p>During the actual compo-time, what I've done so far is just that silly 2D physics demo running at the top of the page (oh, and this website, which is still a mess). I've also tinkered a bit with coherent noise (shown below). Hopefully there will be more stuff here just after September 13! </p>

<p><b>UPDATE (2019-09-03):</b> I've decided agains using webGL. Not because webGL is bad or anything, but to try and create a 3D game using html5 seems more fun at the moment. <a href="demo2/">Check out the work in progress here</a>.</p>

<p><b>UPDATE (2019-10-07):</b> Well, JS13K is long over, and I didn't manage to work on the project much further since the last update. No game.  What I spent the most time on was midi-playback and sound generation. I spent a fair amount of time on affine polygon rendering using html5 canvas, which is a wonky one, and I never got satisfied with the performance. It seemed to run well in Opera, but Firefox is just impossible. It will run poorly if you<br>
  <i>setTransform() -> "mask polygon" -> drawImage()</i><br> 
  a couple of hundred times (like, 200-300)</b></p>

<p>I'm guessing Firefox's canvas renderer does hardware state changes for every of those series of context calls, while Opera/Chrome have some clever way to batch it up. Not that performance is amazing there either. I re-learned a lesson I already knew. The next time I should stick to WebGL, or I'll do a software rendered game like I did in 2015 (which should be MUCH slower, but isn't because of how horrible canvas rendering is for games).</p>


<a href="demo2/">Here's where I left the development.</a>.</p>

<h2>2018</h2>
<p>Last year I tried to make an anti-gravity racing game inspired by WipeOut!</p>



<img src="js13k/js13k18.jpg">

<p><a href="old_site/js13k18/">You can play it right here, but before you do:</a> <i>I should warn you that it's not exactly finished. <b>It also requires a keyboard play</b>.</i><br>
<b>R - Resets the vehicle back on track if (when) you wipe out<br>
Z - Accelerates<br>
X - Zooms<br>
C - Cycles the camera mode<br>
Arrows - Turns</p></b>

<p>WebGL makes the graphics happen. To fit it all into 13K, most of the geometry is generated. The racetrack itself is a tiny road-mesh repeated and made to follow a set of points using cubic interpolation. The final zip weighs in at 12786 bytes.</p>
<p>Here are some gifs I grabbed during the development.</p>

<p><i>Originally I wanted a sea with geometric waves, around the track, but I didn't have time to make it appear seamless as the vehicle rushed past it. I also needed to save space. It had to go.</i></p>

<h2>2015</h2> 

<p>With JS13K 2015, I attempted to write my first software triangle rasterizer. The game I tried to make was a combat flight simulator.</p>
<img src="js13k/fc.gif"/>
<p>The renderer featured perspective-correct textured triangles with bilinear-filtering and Gouraud-shading. The fill-rules were bad, gaps between the triangles everywhere.</p>

<p>The infinite terrain was generated using coherent noise. Some very simple looking buildings were sprinkled randomly here and there.</p>
