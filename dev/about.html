<h3>Background</h3>
<p>I was born in Stockholm in 1990. I've lived in Gothenburg since 2001.</p>

<h3>Education</h3>
<p>I completed high-school (Technical, TE), but I don't have a degree in Computer Science or any other field. I am almost entirely self-taught when it comes to programming, so you will have look through my code (on github) and possibly converse with me in order to get an understanding of my capabilities.</p>

<h3>Work</h3>
<p>I'm working part-time at a content marketing and advertisement bureau, where I've been since 2015. I do a lot of graphic design and layout work for both web and print, and also some technical stuff (Wordpress and other web-related things). </p>

<p>Before 2015 I did similar tasks, but freelance. I do want to become a full-time programmer or game-developer, so please consider hiring me if you have suitable position open.</p>
