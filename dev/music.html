<!--h3>My Music</h3-->

<h3>Making</h3>

<p>I've made music for some of my games, or sometimes just for fun. Sometimes using software like Garage Band or Ableton, sometimes <b>programmatically</b>.</p>

<p>Here's a short and repetitive example of the latter, a tune I made for JS13k once. The entire array of samples is generated using only
  <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="audio.js">javascript</a>. The structure of the tune is made with a bunch of for-loops, which is pretty terrible.</p>


<div id="playbutton" class="tunebtn" onclick="play_tune()">Generate (can take a few seconds) and play</div>

<br>

<p>I also have some music on <a href="https://soundcloud.com/nopykon">my soundcloud page</a>. More to come I hope.</p>

<h3>Listening</h3>
<p>My favorite genres would probably have to be Classical or Rock, but there is so much brilliant stuff out there in lots of genres that it's hard to pick a specific one. Games, and movies, do include some of the best music I've ever heard. That said, not many soundtracks have impressed me lately, because modern well produced accompanying music often lack <i>identity</i>, in my opinion. Some just have no melody, almost pure ambience. Most AAA-games are trying for the <i>Hollywood</i>-style (which can be great!), but not doing the best job at it, resulting in something that doesn't sound bad, but not interesting or memorable either. But that is how it's always going to be. For anyone's taste, the exceptionally good stuff will be released far and few between. And finding it among the insane amount of available content of today will also happen rarely. Probably some of my future favorites, have already been out for years, if not decades (or even centuries now that I think about it).</p>

<p>The demoscene produces a lot of good stuff. I often tune in to <a href="https://www.scenesat.com/">scenesat.com</a> for some of that. I also have gigantic folder with .mod and .xm files by artists like Maktone, Dubmood, Mosaik/Rymdlego, Cerror.... and too many others for me to keep track of. Often, I only know the tune, not the artist.</p>

<p>Here is one example of some brilliant demo musics (and probably my all time favorite demo).</p>

<p>One of Maktones brilliant <i>cracktros</i>. I love most of his tunes because he manages to cram so much <i>feeling</i>, often melancholy or pure happyness, into a very short piece of music. Although some tracks I think can feel a little rushed, but such is the way of the format. Cracktunes and demo-music seem to most of the time be very aimed at grabbing attention, almost like an ads jingle. (To make everyone at the demoparty drop their jaws or something.).</p>

<p>I would love to hear Maktone take his time on a full album, or make a soundtrack or something like that. Take Zelda's OST on NES for comparsion. Slow, buildup (yet,pretty fast to classical music), followed by then similarly compressed music. Zelda's music is either very adventurous, myserious or sad.</p>
